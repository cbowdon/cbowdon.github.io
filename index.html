              <p><a name="computer-vision-theremin" href="https://github.com/cbowdon/Computer-Vision-Theremin">This</a> is an application that uses computer vision to track the user's hand and plays a tone according to the position. This is a simulation of a physical instrument that plays a tone according to the user's hands' distance from its antennae. If the simulation is anything to go by, the real thing is impossible to play.</p>
              <p>From a technical point of view, the notable thing about this is the extension of the Lucas-Kanaarde algorithm to constantly prune and search for new points to track. It's written in C++11, for which I had to modify OpenCV somewhat to get it to build. If I recall correctly the modifications were a fairly straightforward working through of the compiler errors.</p>

              <p>These two ancient projects provide libraries for splitting animated GIFs into the still images. The IOS lib was intended for an iPhone app, a project I quickly abandoned once I realized how tedious submitting and marketing an app would be.</p>
              <p>The Racket lib was mainly to improve my fluency in the language. If you want to learn a Lisp, learn Racket; it's pragmatic, elegant and batteries-included.</p>
              <p>I recall spending a long time reading the GIF specification in order to figure out how to do the decomposition. For normal GIFs these libraries should work well. As a point of interest, during these projects I discovered that the inventor pronounces it 'jif'.</p>

              <p><a name="tsmonad" href="https://github.com/cbowdon/tsmonad">This</a> ports the most useful monads from Haskell to JavaScript/TypeScript. It differs from the million other monad libraries in that it (when used in TypeScript) it provides a strongly-typed emulation of pattern matching that will not compile if you miss a case. See the README for more details. Available on NPM.
