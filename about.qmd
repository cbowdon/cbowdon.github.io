This is the personal blog of Chris Bowdon. Hi! By day I am the CTO of Polecat Intelligence, working with AI and Big Data, but you will be shocked to learn that I am also into maths and code. The posts here cover the bits and pieces I do that are not for work.

If you've spotted an error or have a question about the content on this site, I'd be grateful if you could raise a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/cbowdon/cbowdon.github.io/issues/new).  If you'd like to get in touch about anything else, please look me up on LinkedIn.
