Welcome to my "oh it's about time I had a +decent+ Internet presence" page.

* FAQ
- How can I contact you? :: @cbowdon on Twitter
- What's on your [[https://github.com/cbowdon][GitHub]]? :: Many of my side projects and experiments go there. The more notable repos are probably [[https://github.com/cbowdon/tsmonad][TsMonad, a little monad library for TypeScript]] and my contributions to other open source projects. I apologize in advance for not being a responsive maintainer; this all has to fit in around my three full time jobs (parenting, parenting and employment).
