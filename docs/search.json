This article is ten years old and certainly does not represent best practices in the 2020s.\nThis is something that I seem to have to do on a monthly basis on various projects: a throwaway script that includes getting some resource from the Internet. This means I have to spar with my old nemesis the corporate proxy and her minions, the 407 and the SSL verification error.\n$DAYJOB uses an authenticated proxy and their own root certificate. It’s seamless for Office and IE users because their system is pre-configured. But not for those of us who are spinning up VMs and installing packages and come to think of it almost everything you need to do as a software engineer. (It also can /weaken/ rather than enhance security, the stated aim, but that’s an article for another day.)\nThis is a quick guide-by-example for how to authenticated against a proxy and ignore any SSL verification errors in a variety of scripting languages. The examples use only the standard library for a widely available (read: old) version of each language. The assumption is that if you can’t reach the Internet, you don’t have better packages or newer versions.\nIt is not an example of how to write good production software. It is a catalogue of dirty workarounds. You have been warned."

    "title": "Using Stan from R",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve been trying to get the hang of Bayesian models with Stan. One of the hurdles has been using Stan from R, so in this post I’m jotting down what I’ve learned (mostly the hard way).\n\nRStan or CmdStanR?\nOn the whole I had a much better time using CmdStanR than RStan. When I made a mistake that led to a runtime exception, RStan would simply die with this kind of error:\nError in `unserialize()`:\n! error reading from connection\n     ▆\n  1. └─rstan::stan(...)\n  2.   ├─rstan::sampling(...)\n  3.   └─rstan::sampling(...)\n  4.     └─rstan (local) .local(object, ...)\n  5.       └─parallel::parLapplyLB(cl, X = 1:chains, fun = callFun)\n  6.         ├─base::do.call(...)\n  7.         └─parallel::clusterApplyLB(...)\n  8.           └─parallel:::dynamicClusterApply(cl, fun, length(x), argfun)\n  9.             └─parallel:::recvOneResult(cl)\n 10.               ├─parallel::recvOneData(cl)\n 11.               └─parallel:::recvOneData.SOCKcluster(cl)\n 12.                 └─base::unserialize(socklist[[n]])\nCmdStanR on the other hand would print something useful. Other aspects of the development experience were also nicer:\n\nbetter status updates (e.g. showing when compiling)\neditor support for stan files e.g. linting\n\nI found installing CmdStanR, Stan and the rest of the toolchain from Macports to be very easy. However your mileage may vary when it comes to getting an R installation from Macports, due to some esoteric g95 and xcode compiler errors. I ended up having to locate the R and R-group files on my system and edit them. Hopefully the Macports team will resolve this, because I really appreciate being able to install R from there.\n\n\nEnsure show_messages is TRUE\nFor obvious reasons.\n\n\n“Rejecting initial value” errors\nI got “Rejecting initial value” a lot:\n\nlog probability evaluates to log(0), i.e. negative infinity\n\nThis is trying to tell you that the default initial value chosen by Stan has a probability of zero in your prior. You need to set constraints in the parameters block that match the prior distribution you choose. For example if you chose a uniform(1, 10) prior, you should add the constraint &lt;lower=1, upper=10&gt; to your parameter declaration.\n\n\nDon’t forget to set parallel_chains\nOn my system getOption(\"mc.cores\") was unset and Stan defaulted to running all four chains on a single core. Oops. You can also have within-chain parallelism, but I’ve read varying accounts on the usefulness of this (presumably there’s more communication required, which is usually the death of parallelism gains).\nOther software can apparently use GPUs for calculations by the way (e.g. the TensorFlow-based software) so if you have massive calculations to do those may be worth investigating.\n\n\nMaximum tree-depth warnings\nHitting maximum tree-depth for the majority of samples was because of an identifiability problem in my model.\nThe linked advice within the warning is fairly clear: https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings#maximum-treedepth. If you’re wondering whether your Rhat and ESS values are good, read higher up that page.\n\n\nResolving unidentified or weakly-identified models\nI don’t have a comprehensive understanding of this, but the general idea is that your problem doesn’t have a unique solution, or more precisely there are multiple parameter values that would give the same distribution of observed data. Here’s a dumb example: imagine you are modelling your data as draws from a Normal distribution where the mean is the sum of two parameters, i.e. observations ~ normal(a + b, 1). If a and b don’t correspond to real phenomena captured in your observations, the values could be all over the place and the model will struggle. You need to constrain the parameters.\nA simple way to do this is to transform your parameters with the inverse logistic function, which has a range (output) between 0 and 1. You could also pin one of your parameters to a constant, though I found that harder to follow and more difficult to make work.\nHere’s an example from my F1 project, simplified slightly.\n#| label: stan-constraints-example\ndata {\n  int&lt;lower=1&gt; n_ctrs;\n  int&lt;lower=1&gt; n_drvs;\n  int&lt;lower=1&gt; n_obs;\n  array[n_obs] int&lt;lower=1, upper=20&gt; positions;\n  array[n_obs, 2] int position_indices;\n}\nparameters {\n  // Raw will be sampled from prior distribution\n  vector[n_ctrs] lambda_ctrs_raw;\n  vector[n_drvs] lambda_drvs_raw;\n}\ntransformed parameters {\n  // Transformed will be used as the parameter\n  vector[n_ctrs] lambda_ctrs;\n  vector[n_drvs] lambda_drvs;\n  \n  // The transformed params can only be between 1 and 10\n  // because the inv_logit function has range [0, 1]\n  lambda_ctrs = 1 + 9 * inv_logit(lambda_ctrs_raw);\n  lambda_drvs = 1 + 9 * inv_logit(lambda_drvs_raw);\n}\nmodel {\n  lambda_ctrs_raw ~ std_normal();\n  lambda_drvs_raw ~ std_normal();\n  \n  for (k in 1 : n_obs) {\n    int i = position_indices[k, 1];\n    int j = position_indices[k, 2];\n    positions[k] ~ poisson(exp(lambda_ctrs[i] + lambda_drvs[j]));\n  }"

So a T distribution is a useful proposal for a normal target, because it has fatter tails (as controlled by the df degrees of freedom parameter).\nWe could choose a very sloppy proposal like a uniform distribution, but in that case we are suboptimal in terms of how quickly we explore the space. We would have a relatively high number of samples in the tails compared to the peak. Bååth has a neat method of using a Laplacian approximation as a proposal."

We do know that the budget cap is 135M USD and it’s unlikely that anyone is operating below the cap. We also know that driver and top executive salaries are exempt from the cap. The top teams are spending about 100M USD on their drivers, and prior to the budget cap’s implementation likely invested in facilities that they can use for free (like wind tunnels).\nWith that in mind, I asked GPT-4o to search the web and estimate budgets for the teams.

Not necessarily: this model of constructor performance incorporates an important factor that isn’t clear from the results, but which should affect an objective assessment of which teams are better. Or to put it another way, if I were Max Verstappen I’d still rather be driving the Red Bull than the McLaren next year, because Red Bull’s budget suggests a more capable team overall. (Not to mention the increased wind tunnel time that third place in the constructors’ gets relative to the winner.)\n\n\nCode\nplot_posterior_with_prior &lt;- function(ctrs, prior_mus, prior_sd, fit) {\n  s_post &lt;- sample_posterior(fit) |&gt; mutate(sample = \"posterior\")\n\n  ctr_index &lt;- tibble(constructorRef = ctrs, constructorId = 1:length(ctrs))\n\n  s_prior &lt;- prior_mus |&gt;\n    lapply(\\(mu) rnorm(100000, mu, prior_sd)) |&gt;\n    lapply(as_tibble) |&gt;\n    imap(\\(t, i) mutate(t, constructorId = i, sample = \"prior\")) |&gt;\n    bind_rows() |&gt;\n    rename(position = value) |&gt;\n    merge(ctr_index)\n\n  df &lt;- bind_rows(s_prior, s_post)\n\n  ggplot(df) +\n    aes(x = position, fill = sample) +\n    facet_wrap(~constructorRef) +\n    geom_density(alpha = 0.5, linewidth = 0.1) +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 10, by = 2), limits = c(1, 10)) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"dodgerblue1\", \"dodgerblue4\"))\n}\n\nplot_posterior_with_prior(ctrs, data_list_b$prior_mus, data_list_b$prior_sd, fit.b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Comparison of prior and posterior samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting the priors and posteriors together shows how McLaren over-performed and Mercedes continued to underperform.\n\n\nPast performance\nAnother, very easy way to set the priors is to consider the constructors’ performance over the previous seasons with the same regulations, in this case 2022 and 2023 (the ground-effect era). This is really easy to do - we would just take a weighted mean of the constructors’ finishing positions as mu for our priors, and perhaps set the variance proportional to the difference. Not particularly innovative or interesting though, so let’s skip it.\n\n\nCar-limited circuits\nLong-time F1 fans will know that at some tracks, the cars almost always finish in pairs, e.g. both Ferraris, then both Mercedes, and so on. Somehow at these circuits driver skill makes little difference; we could say the circuits are car-limited rather than driver-limited. That’s no fun to watch, but I wonder if it’s useful for establishing car performance?\nLet’s look back at historic race results to see if some circuits are more likely to finish in two-by-two order. We can score this by the median difference in position between finishing drivers.\n\n\nCode\ncircuits2024 &lt;- races |&gt;\n  merge(circuits) |&gt;\n  filter(year == 2024) |&gt;\n  select(circuitRef)\n\nposition_gaps &lt;- f1data |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt; 2014) |&gt; # hybrid era onwards, to try and keep it relevant to modern F1 car sizes\n  merge(circuits2024) |&gt; # circuits from 2024 only\n  select(year, round, circuitRef, constructorRef, driverRef, position) |&gt;\n  filter(position != \"\\\\N\") |&gt; # ignore DNFs\n  mutate(position = as.integer(position)) |&gt;\n  group_by(year, round, circuitRef, constructorRef) |&gt;\n  filter(n() == 2) |&gt; # must be a double finish\n  summarise(gap = max(position) - min(position), max_position = max(position)) |&gt;\n  group_by(circuitRef) |&gt;\n  mutate(median_gap = median(gap))\n\nggplot(position_gaps) +\n  aes(x = gap) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(circuitRef)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"dodgerblue1\", alpha = 0.5, colour = \"black\", linewidth = 0.1, binwidth = 1) +\n  geom_vline(mapping = aes(xintercept = median_gap), colour = \"dodgerblue4\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Distribution of finishing position gaps between teammates by circuit, with median line.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly given that F1 isn’t a spec series, the gap between drivers of the same car is usually very low. I went back and forth on whether to discard cars that finished outside the top ten points-paying positions, as this often includes cars that were retired to save expense or were wounded but finished the race well below their potential for the sake of data gathering. In the end I kept them in because we need two-car finishes to calculate the statistics and setting a threshold would mean re-coding all the finish positions.\nIt turns out to make little difference anyway. The race with the highest probability of teammates finishing in consecutive positions is Suzuka, whether or not you apply a threshold.\n\n\nCode\nrounds2024 &lt;- races |&gt;\n  filter(year == 2024) |&gt;\n  merge(circuits) |&gt;\n  select(circuitRef, round) |&gt;\n  rename(round2024 = round)\n\np_gap_1 &lt;- position_gaps |&gt;\n  count(circuitRef, gap) |&gt;\n  group_by(circuitRef) |&gt;\n  mutate(p_gap = n / sum(n)) |&gt;\n  filter(gap == 1) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  merge(rounds2024)\n\np_gap_1 |&gt;\n  slice_max(p_gap, n = 10) |&gt;\n  kable(digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Circuits with highest probability of having teammates finishing together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncircuitRef\ngap\nn\np_gap\nround2024\n\n\n\n\nsuzuka\n1\n29\n0.48\n4\n\n\nalbert_park\n1\n19\n0.41\n3\n\n\nrodriguez\n1\n26\n0.39\n20\n\n\njeddah\n1\n10\n0.38\n2\n\n\nyas_marina\n1\n29\n0.36\n24\n\n\nimola\n1\n10\n0.33\n7\n\n\nhungaroring\n1\n26\n0.32\n13\n\n\nshanghai\n1\n15\n0.31\n5\n\n\nbahrain\n1\n25\n0.30\n1\n\n\ninterlagos\n1\n19\n0.30\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did the cars line up at Suzuka in 2024, noting that this was round 4 of a 24-round championship?\n\n\nCode\nsuzuka2024 &lt;- f1data |&gt;\n  filter(year == 2024) |&gt;\n  filter(circuitRef == \"suzuka\") |&gt;\n  select(year, round, circuitRef, constructorRef, driverRef, quali_position, position)\n\nsuzuka2024 |&gt;\n  drop_na() |&gt;\n  group_by(constructorRef) |&gt;\n  filter(n() == 2) |&gt;\n  arrange(position) |&gt;\n  kable()\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Results for Suzuka 2024 (two-car finishes only)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nround\ncircuitRef\nconstructorRef\ndriverRef\nquali_position\nposition\n\n\n\n\n2024\n4\nsuzuka\nred_bull\nmax_verstappen\n1\n1\n\n\n2024\n4\nsuzuka\nred_bull\nperez\n2\n2\n\n\n2024\n4\nsuzuka\nferrari\nsainz\n4\n3\n\n\n2024\n4\nsuzuka\nferrari\nleclerc\n8\n4\n\n\n2024\n4\nsuzuka\nmclaren\nnorris\n3\n5\n\n\n2024\n4\nsuzuka\naston_martin\nalonso\n5\n6\n\n\n2024\n4\nsuzuka\nmercedes\nrussell\n9\n7\n\n\n2024\n4\nsuzuka\nmclaren\npiastri\n6\n8\n\n\n2024\n4\nsuzuka\nmercedes\nhamilton\n7\n9\n\n\n2024\n4\nsuzuka\nhaas\nhulkenberg\n12\n11\n\n\n2024\n4\nsuzuka\naston_martin\nstroll\n16\n12\n\n\n2024\n4\nsuzuka\nhaas\nkevin_magnussen\n18\n13\n\n\n2024\n4\nsuzuka\nalpine\nocon\n15\n15\n\n\n2024\n4\nsuzuka\nalpine\ngasly\n17\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cars are quite well in order here, if you ignore the gulf between Alonso and Stroll. It looks like Suzuka is really a car-limited track. Incidentally, this would suggest that in round 4, McLaren and Mercedes were quite evenly matched.\n\nCounter-arguments\nAre we sure Suzuka is a car-limited track?\n\nSuzuka is a track “drivers love”! Surely it’s a more skill-dependent track?\nI would have expected so! Suzuka is described as a technical track, with minimal room for error. Perhaps there aren’t as many potential lines that a driver could take to distinguish themselves. It’s also a good track for overtaking, so any driver that does qualify out of position is able to recover. Or perhaps the reason drivers love it is because they get to drive their cars on the limit: the limit of the car’s performance.\nEither way, statistically drivers are more likely to end up in pairs in Suzuka than anywhere else.\n\n\nSuzuka was an early round. Perhaps car performance converges over the season?\nOn the one hand we’d expect to see cars start at different levels but converge throughout the season, as the teams spot innovations on other cars that they can copy. Or secret design documents that they can copy, ahem. On the other hand, constructors in a tight battle would be motivated to develop their cars further - for example in 2022 when Red Bull overhauled an early Ferrari advantage.\nAs it happens, historically Suzuka has been mid-to-late season, which suggests that being an early round in 2024 isn’t the reason for being car-limited.\n\n\nCode\nraces |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt;= 2014) |&gt;\n  group_by(year) |&gt;\n  mutate(n_rounds = n_distinct(round)) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  merge(circuits) |&gt;\n  filter(circuitRef == \"suzuka\") |&gt;\n  select(year, round, n_rounds) |&gt;\n  arrange(year, round) |&gt;\n  kable()\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: Suzuka’s placement in each season\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nround\nn_rounds\n\n\n\n\n2014\n15\n19\n\n\n2015\n14\n19\n\n\n2016\n17\n21\n\n\n2017\n16\n20\n\n\n2018\n17\n21\n\n\n2019\n17\n21\n\n\n2022\n18\n22\n\n\n2023\n16\n22\n\n\n2024\n4\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever the fact that it was an early round in 2024 does mean that car performance will have changed over the season. Suzuka can only ever be a point-in-time assessment.\n\n\nAre we sure that consecutive finishes aren’t indicative of similar driver skill levels?\nThe top teams can also hire the best drivers, is it not possible that we’re still seeing the drivers finishing in skill order? I.e. it’s actually driver-limited, but the drivers happen to be mostly paired with similarly-fast drivers. Alonso and Stroll being the clear exception in the 2024 race results.\nOn the other hand, between 2023 and 2024 there were no line-up changes among the top 5 teams, so we can easily compare across the two years.\n\n\nCode\nsuzuka2023 &lt;- f1data |&gt;\n  filter(year == 2023) |&gt;\n  filter(circuitRef == \"suzuka\") |&gt;\n  select(year, round, circuitRef, constructorRef, driverRef, quali_position, position)\n\nsuzuka2023 |&gt;\n  drop_na() |&gt;\n  group_by(constructorRef) |&gt;\n  filter(n() == 2) |&gt;\n  arrange(position) |&gt;\n  kable()\n\n\n\n\nTable 8: Results for Suzuka 2024 (two-car finishes only)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nround\ncircuitRef\nconstructorRef\ndriverRef\nquali_position\nposition\n\n\n\n\n2023\n16\nsuzuka\nmclaren\nnorris\n3\n2\n\n\n2023\n16\nsuzuka\nmclaren\npiastri\n2\n3\n\n\n2023\n16\nsuzuka\nferrari\nleclerc\n4\n4\n\n\n2023\n16\nsuzuka\nmercedes\nhamilton\n7\n5\n\n\n2023\n16\nsuzuka\nferrari\nsainz\n6\n6\n\n\n2023\n16\nsuzuka\nmercedes\nrussell\n8\n7\n\n\n2023\n16\nsuzuka\nalpine\nocon\n14\n9\n\n\n2023\n16\nsuzuka\nalpine\ngasly\n12\n10\n\n\n2023\n16\nsuzuka\nalphatauri\nlawson\n11\n11\n\n\n2023\n16\nsuzuka\nalphatauri\ntsunoda\n9\n12\n\n\n2023\n16\nsuzuka\nhaas\nhulkenberg\n18\n14\n\n\n2023\n16\nsuzuka\nhaas\nkevin_magnussen\n15\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe order of constructors is very different, despite all drivers being the same except for Alpha Tauri/RB.

We can only really say that this reflects car performance at tracks like Suzuka. Suzuka is a high-speed, high-downforce track with more high-speed than low-speed corners. You can kind of tell by looking that only corners 2, 9, 11, and 14 are slow.\n\n\n\nSuzuka Circuit Layout\n\n\nData and image from the F1 Formbook.\nSo perhaps another way of looking at it is that low-speed corners are where drivers make the most difference. That aligns with the excellent recent analysis by Mark Hughes where he explains how drivers like Leclerc and Hamilton make up their time in slow corners.\nNaturally certain cars will also be better at slow corners, and that’s not represented at Suzuka. We might be able to gain a better understanding with sector times, but sadly I don’t have this data.\n\n\n\n\nSuzuka-based priors\nAt this point I’m convinced enough that Suzuka is a useful indicator of relative car performance to be a prior, so let’s take the position of each team’s fastest car round Suzuka as constructor performance priors. Luckily there weren’t any double-DNFs - at least one car from each team finished - so every team is represented.\nThe Stan model is the same, we’re just injecting different prior mus and SDs.\n\n\nCode\nsuzuka_positions &lt;- suzuka2024 |&gt;\n  drop_na() |&gt;\n  group_by(constructorRef) |&gt;\n  summarise(position = min(position)) |&gt;\n  mutate(position = rank(position)) |&gt;\n  arrange(constructorRef)\n\ndata_list_suzuka &lt;- make_data_list(ctr_positions)\ndata_list_suzuka$prior_mus &lt;- suzuka_positions$position\ndata_list_suzuka$prior_sd &lt;- 1\n\nfit_suzuka &lt;- run_stan(data_list_suzuka, \"f1.b.stan\")\n\nplot_posterior(fit_suzuka)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Posterior samples for the Suzuka-position priors.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not dramatically different. It shouldn’t be, the model and data are the same and the priors are very similar to the budget-based priors - the fun was in figuring out that Suzuka is car-limited.\n\n\nCode\nplot_posterior_with_prior(ctrs, data_list_suzuka$prior_mus, data_list_suzuka$prior_sd, fit_suzuka)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Posterior samples alongside the Suzuka-position priors.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost teams didn’t move far from their priors. I’d draw similar conclusions to before: the McLaren was fastest, Red Bull was a close second, and Ferrari were not far behind.\n\n\nCode\nsp &lt;- sample_posterior(fit_suzuka)\nsp |&gt;\n  group_by(constructorRef) |&gt;\n  summarise(mu = mean(position), sigma = sd(position)) |&gt;\n  arrange(mu) |&gt;\n  kable(digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\nTable 10: Mean and SD from posterior sample, with Suzuka priors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconstructorRef\nmu\nsigma\n\n\n\n\nred_bull\n2.01\n0.31\n\n\nmclaren\n2.05\n0.32\n\n\nferrari\n2.42\n0.32\n\n\nmercedes\n3.39\n0.39\n\n\naston_martin\n6.07\n0.49\n\n\nrb\n7.47\n0.56\n\n\nhaas\n7.77\n0.58\n\n\nalpine\n8.55\n0.64\n\n\nsauber\n9.08\n0.52\n\n\nwilliams\n9.39\n0.44"

Though I note that the drivers near the bottom of the performance rankings in my model were more DNF-prone in 2024 anyway, so perhaps there’s a correlation between low performance and DNFs, or those drivers had some races where they wounded the car but finished anyway."

    "text": "Only a single season considered\nWith more data for each driver - across different cars - the model would be better able to distinguish driver and car performance. Note that it would be necessary to model each constructor by year because the car performance varies so much.\nThis suggests that we might benefit from having multiple representations of car performance within each year, e.g. splitting each team into A and B specs according to when they brought their largest upgrade. The challenge with that (apart from the tedious business of determining the break points) is that we’d have less data for each car and also there are perhaps several step changes in performance throughout the season."
